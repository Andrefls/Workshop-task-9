# In the end, you are the person in the mirror.


## Synopsis

- This is an experimental work. After reviewing the lecture example, I decided to focus on experimenting with the code features and tweaking them to my taste. Since exercise 7, I had asked Leo about changing the background for an image, so this exercise was a perfect opportunity to develop that idea further.

## Summary/Problem-Solving

- I began the task by using the provided example. I watched the module video a couple of times.

- I started copying the lecture example into my VS Codium. However, after replicating almost identical code, the video was no longer visible.

- This was my first learning curve: my computer has a different resolution, causing the video to appear as a small square at the bottom of my browser page.

- I decided to start tweaking the exercise. After a few trials, I managed to set up my screen correctly.

- Next, I wanted to implement the background. The first step was to download some images and also use one of my old drawings.

- I used Photoshop to make some simple adjustments to my drawings and pictures I found online, and I achieved a decent result.

- At the end of the exercise, it mentioned creating a mirror effect, so I literally wanted to create a mirror.

- However, I faced a challenge; I had the basics for adding the background, but I had never actually experimented with the code before.

- So, I began working on some trials. Although it didn’t work perfectly at first, it slowly started to take shape.

- I referred to some previous exercises I had completed to upload and set up the pictures, and eventually, everything worked.

- I wanted to add some interactivity, so I created a dropdown option for users. However, the setup didn’t work as intended, which led me to learn something new: how to set up an event to control the background settings. In the end, it worked out!

  
## Future development

I would like to learn how to retrieve information about movement so that I can replicate it in my drawings. The expressions of the human body when observing something are very important to me.

## Conclusion

Sometimes, simple things allow you to experiment further. It’s essential to spend a good amount of time making your work meaningful. In this example, I aimed to create a reflection that helps me realize that we are all just the person behind the mirror.
